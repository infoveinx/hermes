Python examples for interacting with MySQL and RabbitMQ.  This is part of a now defunct project that involved shipping events in an IDS (intrusion detection system) database to another database using a RMQ proxy.  Authentication to RMQ is done using certificates.  The username is the CommonName from the certificate.  This code was never polished so I can only hope that some portions of it are useful to someone else.

## Requirements
* Python3
